Engineering is not only about construction but also about demolition, enabling existing space to be reutilized. 
Demolition can thus be defined as a set of removal works to be applied to an existing structure leading to a new space availability. 
Demolition work can be partial or global and can be used on new or old structures (Brito, 1999).
